# MS-RemoveYourselfFromATeam

In my university, we use Microsoft Teams. And I've noticed that there is no exit button for a team unless you're the owner...

so I created this tool for removing myself from a team of the term before.

I hope that works. 

BTW I did not like Powershell. It could be better. Much better.
